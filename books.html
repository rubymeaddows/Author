      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
  Who is the killer? Who is protecting the lie? And how far will the four go before the truth starts fading back into old, poisoned tales and death closes in on them?
</p>

<p>
  When two young boys are found dead in the damp, raining woods, the town erupts in chaos and whispers. A teenage girl is apprehended as the prime suspect and placed under mental care. Lenora Vexley, a talented but extreme therapist, is tasked with unravelling the psychotic and broken mind of Ravella Dace. But as truth and reflections blur, Lenora is forced to face her own ruins.
</p>

<p>
  Sergeant Damian Thornfield, an enigmatic man with authority stitched into him, leads the case with a friend and trusted accomplice, Kai Wong, whose spontaneity and ease mask something haunting and unspoken.
</p>

<p>
  As the four of them dig into the graves too deep, their past meddles with the paths, and the killer moves closer—always twelve steps ahead and leaving no trace behind.
