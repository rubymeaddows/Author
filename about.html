    <h2>Meet R. V. Meaddows</h2>
    <p>
      R. V. Meaddows, who goes by Sidra Noor, is a 15-year-old writer from a small town in India. 
      Fascinated by art, literature, and history, she spends most days buried in classic novels, 
      sketching forgotten faces, or researching strange events that never made it into textbooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 14, she began writing her debut thriller <em>If The Silence Fell</em>—an atmospheric, 
      tightly wound story inspired by the works of legendary classic and crime thriller authors. 
      It was published a year later, marking the start of a literary voice that leans into mystery, 
      tension, and the darker corners of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a keen eye for detail and a knack for crafting complex characters, she is poised to make 
      a lasting impact on the world of fiction.
